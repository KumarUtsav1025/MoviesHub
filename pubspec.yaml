  # To add asset to your application, add an asset section, like this:
  # asset:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding asset from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: GentiumBookPlus
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/GentiumBookPlus-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/GentiumBookPlus-Italic.ttf
        - style: italic
    - family: Arima
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Arima-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Arima-Medium.ttf
        - style: italic
      #   - family: Trajan Pro
